# Description

  This is an implementation of the game [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), where the players will take turns marking spaces in a 3 by 3 grid.  A player wins by placing three marks in a line; either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The human player may choose to go first (as X's) or second (as O's), and the computer will play the opposite role.
